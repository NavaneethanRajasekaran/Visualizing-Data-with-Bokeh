# Visualizing-Data-with-Bokeh
Bokeh is an interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation. Its goal is to provide elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and to extend this capability with high-performance interactivity over very large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily create interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.

I have tried to make an interactive visualization of NYC flight delays. In this I have cleaned the data and tried  some Feature engineering to create aggreated features for the data.

Please find the video for the instruction to run the Bokeh_Main.py code and Report.html for explanation.
